[!] Welcome to DÃ©verser, a simple script to dump onboard SHSH (Blobs) with a valid Generator for iOS devices...
[!] This script will allow you to use dumped blobs with futurerestore at a later date (depending on SEP compatibility)...
[!] This fork works only on iOS, please do not use it on any other platform.
